# Comparison of AI Semantic features and radiomics features for COVID-19 differentiation
### The source code of BigBiGAN training for semantic feature extreaction, and radiomics feature extraction, and linear classifier and Lasso classifier used in the study.

### To ensure reproducibility, please execute the following code in the order mentioned in the paper.

* Detailed instruction (by the order) of using the code is as follows.

* 1. BigBiGAN_Learning: Training of the BigBiGAN framework for 120-dimensional AI sementic features extraction.

* 2. Pyradiomics for 120-dimensional radiomics features extraction.

* 3. Classifiers: The execution code of linear classifier and Lasso classifier. The output are the ROC curves and the prediction accuracy obtained by each classifier on your datasets.
